---------| ---------| ---------| ---------| ---------|---------|
Excellent|   All javadoc is properly formatted, clear, concise. In-line comments are used judiciously and contribute to reader's understanding of code. "Works Cited" section is complete.           |   Code has a consistent style and is easy to read. Whitespace is used effectively; identifier names contribute to reader's understanding of the code.          | Object-oriented design principles have used correctly and effectively. Inheritance, composition, and other relationships are well-justified, even intuitive.            | Game play works correctly, smoothly, and intuitively   |           |
Adequate|  Javadocs are present but difficult to read; in-line comments are excessive or underutilized; "Works Cited" section has problems.  | Principles of style are evident but not consistently applied; areas of the code are not easy to read; too many identifiers are unhelpfully named. |  Object-oriented design is present, but some design decisions seem arbitrary or  unjustified             |Game behavior is mostly correct, but has some unexpected/incorrect behavior            |
Needs Work | Javadoc, in-line comments, and/or "Works Cited" are minimal or missing.            |  No consistent style has been applied; code is difficult to read.           | Little evidence of an object-oriented design   | Code doesn't run; game doesn't really play            |

Documentation (15) =  10. Minimal doccomments and other comments   
Style (25) =  25. 
Design (20) =   15.  Objects should be more "object oriented" see comments in SimpleGame  
Correctness (40) =  35. Why do all the falling objects only fall to the right??   
  
Total =   85.
